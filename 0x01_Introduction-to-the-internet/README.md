 I am so excited to have this opportunity to code again after years and try It again,
 I am documenting this so that in the future i'll look back and appreciate how far i've come
 
 
 I"ll try to do my best(multitasking with my schoolwork) to learn it the best way I can,I am expecting to learn;
 
   1.HTML
   2.CSS
   3.Javascript
   i am already learning how to use  [Visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)and this github where i will be posting my work.
   
   Let's get started ðŸ˜‰
